<h3>Quick Reference</h3>

-----------------------------------------------------------------

- **Pokemon Stats** --> `%stats <pokemon>`

example: `%stats squirtle`

This command tells you the type, base/max stats, abilities, and suggested rank of the \<pokemon>.

- **What Moves a Pokemon can learn** --> `%pokelearns <pokemon>`

example: `%pokelearns squirtle`

This command tells you what moves a pokemon can learn, organized by rank.

- **Finding Move Definitions** --> `%move <move>`
 
example: `%move tackle`
 
This command tells you everything relating to the move.
 
- **Items and what they do** --> `%item`

example: `%item <item>` OR `%item`

This command gives you the item's description, and any properties it has.
You may use %item by itself for a list of catagories.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

<h3>Lists</h3>

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Quick note: `%lists` will display every available list.
- How do they work?

Lists are a collection of either pokemon or items. They are very convenient in situations where you want a random pokemon from a group. Item lists work slightly differently.

Pokemon lists are the most common, so I'll go over them first.

- **Creating, Modifying, and Deleting lists** --> `%list <listname> (add/show/del) (poke1, poke2, etc)`
	- **Creating Lists**:
	
		Lets say you have a set group of pokemon for a grassland/field area. (In this example those pokemon will be Ponyta, Furret, Sentret, and Watchog.)
		
		Keep in mind everyone can see your list's name, so **try to make the name unique but not too personal**. (If you see a list that suites your needs feel free to use it - but if you're able to modify it please @shadeslayer in the pokerole discord. That's not supposed to happen)
		
		Since my username is ShadeSlayer I'll use shade_ to prefix my lists. This is just personal preference, any name will work.
		
		To create my grassland list I'll use **%list shade_grassland add Ponyta, Furret, Sentret, Watchog**
		
		Ta-da! You can try `%list shade_grassland` to check that it worked.
		
	- **Modifying Lists**:
		
		This is very similar to creating a list.
		
		Lets add Gligar to the previous example of shade_grassland:
		
		`%list shade_grassland add Gligar`
		
		And that's it!
		
	- **Deleting Lists:**
		
		To delete a list you have 3 options (using shade_grassland as the example):
		1. %list shade_grassland del
		
			This option deletes the list itself. Use with caution.
			
		2. %list shade_grassland del gligar, ponyta, etc
			
			This option allows you to delete specific pokemon from the list.
			
		3. %listsub shade_grassland shade_field
		
			This option removes the pokemon in *shade_grassland* that are in common with *shade_field*.
			
			More in-depth examples [here](#listsub)

- **Quickly adding lots of similar pokemon**
	- **The filter command and why it's so useful** --> `%filter listname rank type type2 includeLowerRanks generation`
		
		This command may look complicated, but it's a lot simpler to use than it appears.
		(Keep in mind that %filter only appends pokemon - it's possible to accidentally create duplicate pokemon)
		
		First off: the arguments. What do they mean?
		
		1. **`listname`**
		
		This is the list that you want the pokemon to go in. This command will create the list if necessary.
		
		2. **`rank`**
		
		The suggested rank of pokemon you want in the list. 'Beginner', for example, will return the pokemon like bulbasaur, pidgey, swinub, etc.
		
		3. **`type`**
		
		The pokemon type you want (Grass/Fire/etc). This parameter is currently required bc there are... a lot of pokemon.
		
		4. **`type2`**
		
		The secondary type you want. You can put 'any' to accept all secondary typings, or 'none' to restrict to only single-type pokemon.
		
		If you have a specific area in mind, it might be useful to combine 'grass poison' and 'grass ground', or subtract(#listsub) 'grass none' from a list made with 'grass poison'.
		
		5. **`includeLowerRanks`**
		
		If rank is 'Amateur', include 'Starter' and 'Beginner'?
		6. **`generation`**
		
		Restrict the search to a generation? (1 = Kanto, 2 = Johto, ..., 8 = Galar)
		
		Default is all generations/no restriction.
		
	- **<h4 id='listsub'>Listsub and why it's useful</h4>** --> `%listsub list1 list2`
		
		Want to subtract two lists? This command is the one you want.
		
		Let's say you have a list for a grassland. shade_grassland has every Beginner-rank grass-type.
		You also have a list for a forest. shade_forest has Bellsprout, Pidgey, Bulbasaur, Houndour.
		
		In this case I want to remove the pokemon in shade_grassland that are also in shade_forest (Bellsprout, Bulbasaur).
		
		`%listsub shade_grassland shade_forest` will remove the pokemon from shade_grassland, and will not affect the list shade_forest.
- <h5>Overview of item lists</h5>
		
	Item lists are new, so if they don't work correctly please @shadeslayer
		
	These lists use the same format as [weighted encounters](#weighted-encounters). That is, you need to specify the item rarity up front. (Note: To make all the items guaranteed and the same rarity, give them a 100% chance.)

	Format: `%list <listname> add xx% pokeball, greatball yy% oran berry, cheri berry zz% black belt, bright powder`

	For example: I want to make a list for what berries are found in a forest. I'll name the list 'shade_berries' (name doesn't matter, just make it somewhat unique). I want to make *oran berries, cheri berries, and chesto berries* common, *wacan berries, shuca berries, and tanga berries* uncommon, and *sitrus berries, lum berries, and jaboca berries* rare.
	
	I decide that there should be a 30% chance to draw nothing. I arbitrarily decide that common rarity should be a 40% chance, uncommon has 25% chance, and rare has a 5% chance.
	
	`%list shade_berries add 40% oran berry, cheri berry, chesto berry, 25% wacan berry, shuca berry, tanga berry, 5% sitrus berry, lum berry, jaboca berry` (note the missing 30%, this is to note the 30% chance for nothing)
	
	Now that I have an item list, I can either use [`%random`](#random-from-a-list) to draw a random item, or change the [`%settings`](#how-to-add-items-to-random-encounters) to make pokemon in `%encounter` start with it!

<h3>Random Encounters</h3>

-----------------------------------------------------------------
- **How do they work?**

	`%encounter` was created to make random encounters more streamlined. It uses information from `%stats`, `%pokelearns`, and `%moves` to give a nice presentation of a randomly generated pokemon. (If you have feedback on how to make this output look nicer, please DM shadeslayer)
	
	Note that you can use a **shorter form for quick use** - `%e poke1, list1` for encounter, and `%we xx% poke1 yy% list1` for the weighted encounter
- **Encounters** --> `%encounter <number> <rank> <poke1, poke2, list>`
	
	This command creates *\<number>* of pokemon randomly selected from *\<poke1, poke2, list>* at the rank *\<rank>*.
	
	\<Number> can be 1-6 (to avoid spam)
	
	\<Rank> can be any basic rank ('Starter', 'Beginner', etc) or 'Base' - pokemon generated are at their suggested ranks. Useful if you have a Shinx and Luxray in the same list and want them to retain their suggested power levels.
	
	\<poke1, poke2, list> is any combination of pokemon and lists. `Chansey, Litwick, Pidgey`. `shade_forest`. `shade_forest, Chansey`. (Note: lists are case-sensitive)
- **I want a chance for rarer encounters to be mixed in** --> `%wEncounter <number> <rank> <separatePools> <pokemon>`

	This command allows you to have weighted/chance based encounters!
	
	\<number> and \<rank> are the exact same as in `%encounter`.
	\<separatePools> is the following: do you want pokemon from different rarities to be mixed together, or do you want them to be in 'packs'?
	If it's `True`: Pokemon are grouped by rarity. This allows you to separate encounters further, and makes something like `50% pidgey, spinarak, growlithe 50% pidgey, ponyta, ekans` easier to visualize.
	If it's `False`: Pokemon are drawn completely randomly from the given percents.
	
	Here's an example:
	
	My forest area is filled with wurmple and pidgey. Occasionally you'll find a diglett. Rarely you'll find a ponyta. I want the party to encounter a group of 3 pokemon. I want these pokemon to be from the same rarity (all ponyta, all diglett, or mixed pidgey and wurmple). These pokemon should all be at their suggested ranks.
	
	Aribitrarily, I decide that wurmple and pidgey have a 80% chance to be seen, diglett have a 17% chance to be seen, and ponyta have the remaining 3%.
	
	`%wEncounter 3 base True 80% wurmple, pidgey 17% diglett 3% ponyta`
	
	Generally though, separatePools `False` is recommended. Also note that you can mix pokemon and lists.
