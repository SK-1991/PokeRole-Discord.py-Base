# PokeRole-Discord.py-Base
Just a collection of database csv files and a small script for use in a python-based discord bot.

If you want to help out with the movelist, please follow these guidelines to make the process more streamlined:

    1. Check out a branch from the region you want, and name it region-poke_#_start-poke_#_end.
    2. After making your additions, create a pull request to merge it with the main region list.
    3. Keep in mind that the csv list is ordered exactly the same as the pokerole rulebook.
    That's it!

Let's say I want to add 5 pokemon to the alola region. The most recent branch lists 7xx-733. I would create a new branch from alolan-region-moves, and name it alolan-734-739. After I finish my changes, I would commit them and create a pull request.
