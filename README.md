# PokeRole-Discord.py-Base
Just a collection of database csv files and a small script for use in a python-based discord bot.

Next goal: Add every item into the csv file.

How to help: Send a message in the #resources--talk channel to avoid work overlap! Work goes on the update-items branch please.

Just have the last 40 Pokemon to go!
Thank you rrezende88 and SK91 for helping with the last 2 generations!
